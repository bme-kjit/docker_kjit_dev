# Set the sshd_config (only necessary at first time):

	# Add the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	X11UseLocalhost no

	# Check the sshd_config for syntax error (if you kill your ssh that will be painful in these times),

	sudo sshd -t

	# Restart the sshd service
	sudo systemctl restart sshd

# The server and the client has to be started on the same machine:
# Start the carla server, by running the following command
docker-compose run --service-ports carla_server

# Start the client with remote display with the following command in a MobaXterm session (it is responsible for X forwarding)
./start_remote_client.sh

#Test:
cd /workspace/carla/PythonAPI/examples  # pull the repository if necessary
python manual_control.py --host 172.17.0.1 --res 400x200 # Change the IP if necessary, look at the explanation below


# Inside the container the server can be reached with ip 172.17.0.1
